Important Libraries to load:
  -Tweepy, Pillow, wget, Google Cloud Vision API libraries
  
You need to make sure that you create a folder in order for wget to download the images from the Twitter API into, in my example I used "twitter_images", of which you should store the main script in there, because the FFMPEG command runs on images stored in the same directory with it.
