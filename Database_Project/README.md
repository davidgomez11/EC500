The files in this folder represent the MongoDB assignments for the Database portion of the class.

## **Phase 1**
Import airport location data and parse through it.
Demonstrate Read Data, Update Data, and Search/Find Data

## **Phase 2**
* Go back to Project 1:  Twitter+FFMPEG+Google Vision 
* Design database to implement persistent user stories 
    * Detail information of every transaction the user may run using your system 
    * Retrieve information about twitter handles in your system, 
        * Description of the media they have 
        * Description of videos generated 
        * Collective statistics about overall usage of the system.  For example 
            * Number of images per feed 
            * Most popular descriptors 
            * Relationship between Google Trending terms and Twitter feeds

## **Phase 3**
*Develop scripts to run your new system (combined project 1 + Database project) with at least 20 twitter handles for at 
least 3 consecutive days (I don’t want you to go over your free Google Vision API limits)
	*You can use most popular Twitter users	
*Use your module to provide daily stats about overall trending topics and usage
